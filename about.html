            <h1>About Rabbi Brander</h1>
            <img src="./content/asher_brander.jpg" class="column">
            <p class="column">A native of Oak Park, Michigan, he studied at Yeshiva University (where he received his Bachelors, Masters and Semicha), Yeshivat Shaalvim, and the Gruss Kollel in Jerusalem before coming to Los Angeles in 1990. While a member of YOLA’s Kollel (under Rabbi Nachum Sauer), he began his illustrious teaching career at YULA Boys and Girls High Schools. In 1994, he embarked upon his much beloved tenure at the Kehilla. Through teaching several classes every week, he has touched thousands of people with his deep compassion, intellectual brilliance, and spiritual warmth. Recently, Rabbi Brander has begun publishing “Reflections” on the Parsha and life, which goes out to several thousands of people weekly – something that brings him great nachas ruach. Since LINK’s inception in 2002, Rabbi Brander has guided the Kollel’s development; from recruiting the original team of scholars from Israel to shaping its vision and opening its doors to the LA Jewish community and beyond. Most impressively, he has created a very broad and diverse donor base that has proved to be durable and resilient, expanding to meet the burgeoning needs of the Kollel.</p>
